Hey there. I am a game developer for the Roblox game Shady Joe's van of candy. I am the animator and scripter. Only use my email for bug reports, feedback, and collaboration requests.

I'm a really unpopular person right now, so not much people know me. You might not even be reading this right now because of what a small person I am.
